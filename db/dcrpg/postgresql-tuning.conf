# PostgreSQL tuning suggestions (adjust for your machine).

# To apply these changes, edit the existing postgresql.conf that is in use on
# your system.
# - Arch: /var/lib/postgres/data/postgresql.conf
# - Ubuntu: /etc/postgresql/{{.pg_version}}/main/postgresql.conf
# - Mac: /usr/local/var/postgres/postgres.conf
# Be sure to restart PostgreSQL after saving the config.

# Always use the autovacuum process, especially for normal operation! For fast
# queries during normal operation, it is critical to have regular table
# statistics collected by the autovacuum process.

# This is the most important setting for fast initial database population.
# OK for general use on a stable system. Insert with alacrity.
